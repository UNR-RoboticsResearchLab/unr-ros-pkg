wmm_point.c
===========

Januar 28, 2010
Renamed wmm_cmd.c to wmm_point.c
Now prints the values for X,Y and Declination at poles 
Print Xdot instead of dx etc.
Deleted redundant Geoid.Geoid_Initialized = 0 at beginning of wmm_point.c

Decemb 29, 2010
Added ISO reading functionality to wmm_point.c creating wmm_point_ISO.c

Novemb 22, 2011
Reworked wmm_point.c to not include Geoid as a .bin file, but rather as a header file.
Removed the dependence on some global constants for determining the maximum degree of a model.
Fixed memory leaks.

WMMHeader.h
===========
 
Januar 28, 2010
Adding UseGeoid in the Geodetic Coordinate object
Defined M_PI as ((2)*(acos(0.0)))

Decemb 29, 2010
Added ISO reading prototype functions, as well as definitions necessary for ISO reading


Novemb 22, 2011
Removed some global constants for determining the maximum degree of a mangnetic model.


GeomagnetismLibrary.c
==============
Januar 28, 2010
Removed WMM_Warnings(3)
Changed %lf to %d in the help section of geomag introduction, refrencing the epoch which has typecast int.
Changed all WMM_warnings 4 to 3, and WMM_warnings 5 to 4.
Commented out line 1329 in sublibrary HaG = HaE
The PrintUserData function now prints the chosen height (ie ellipsoid or geoid depending on users entry).
Fix Date to year to include special leapdays every four hundred years, and so on. 
Changed WMM_error from char to void.
Changed Geomag_Introduction to read correct phone numbers (303)497-4642 or 6522
Added "above msl" and so on in wmm_printUserData
Changed typo "MSL" at the end of wmm_get user grid to read "WGS-84 ellipsoid", for the use of GridProgramDirective.txt
Deleted redundant function WMM_PrintToFile
Changed GetUserGrid to ask the user for either Height above: mean sea level, or WGS-84 ellipsoid, rather than Geoid or Ellipsoid.
Added a print option tree on grid program directive
Deleted unused variable declaration of "CoordGeodeticString" (type: CoordGeodeticStr) in WMM_GetUserData
Deleted unused variable declaration of "format" (type: int) in WMM_GetUserData.
Deleted unused variable declarations of "i, j, k" (type: int) in WMM_Grid subroutine.
Deleted unused variable declarations of "dummy" (type: double) in WMM_SummationSpecial, and WMM_SecVarSummationSpecial.
Changed %lf to %d as "n" is an integer in WMM_Comparison in the final printf line (currently 3104).
Deleted unused variable declaration of "SphVariables" (type: WMMtype_SphericalHarmonicVariables) in WMM_Comparison.
Deleted unused variable declaration of "MagneticResultsSph" (type: WMMtype_MagneticResults) in WMM_Comparison.
Deleted unused variable declaration of "RMS" (type: double) in WMM_Comparison.
Deleted unused variable declaration and assignment of "l" (type: int) in WMM_Grid subroutine.
Deleted unused variable declaration c_new and c_new2 (type: char array) in WMM_readMagneticModel_Large
Equations are numbered according to the revised WMM Technical Report


Decemb 29, 2010
Fixed an incorrect comparison in WMM_AllocateModelMemory.  If statements now check that the memory is null before printing an error.
Added the ISO reading functions.

June 15, 2011
Various minor bug fixes to eleminate the warnings that showed up while compiling the WMM codes.


Novemb 22, 2011
Fixed memory leaks.


Decemb 14, 2011
Removed upper limit on altitude, the lower limit remains -10 km.

April 20, 2012
WMM_SubLibrary renamed GeomagnetismLibrary.c
All prepends (WMM and EMM) updated to MAG.
Library has been reformatted to support ease of use.  Functions have been split into the following categories:
-User Interface
-Memory and File Processing
-Conversions, Transformations, and other Calculations
-Spherical Harmonics
-Geoid
The documentation has been similarly updated.
All references to ISO (coefficient files) incorrectly implied an international standard.  This has been renamed to SHDF (Serial Header-Data Format).
Fixed an issue with pointer depth for MAG_readMagModels_SHDF.
MAG_AllocateSphVarMemory now returns a pointer.
MAG_SphericalToCartesian has been added.
MAG_YearToDate has been added.
Removed the unused Magnetic Model dependency in MAG_SetDefaults.

wmm_file.c
===========
Januar 28, 2010
Added the GeomagIntroduction to wmm_file.c
Changed "sample_coords.txt" and "sample_out.txt" to "sample_input_file.txt" and "sample_output_file.txt" respectively.
Changed "westen" to "western" in wmm_file.c on line 243ish, and changed AMSL to above MSL on line 234.
Added a new control:  M for MSL, E for WGS84
Changed user instructions
sample_input_file.txt now has options M and E


Decemb 29, 2010
Added ISO reading functionality to wmm_file.c creating wmm_file_ISO.c

Novemb 22, 2011
Fixed memory leaks.
Removed dependence on global constants for determining maximum degree of magnetic model.
Reworked wmm_point.c to not include Geoid as a .bin file, but rather as a header file.


wmm_grid.c
==========
Januar 28, 2010
Fixed spacing on get user grid dialog
Added GV option on get user grid function, as well as all of the secular variation options.
Grid function now gives altitude choice, the print user data function now correctly does the altitude thing too.
Give the information that was input by the user in "grid program directive"
Let the user choose the output filename.
Put the filename used on gridprogramdirective
The "GridProgramDirective.txt" file is now appended rather than written to
Deleted unused variable declarations of "max_a, max_b, max_c, i" (type:int) in main, in wmm_grid.c.
Deleted unused variable declaration of "buffer" (type: char) in main, in wmm_grid.c.

Decemb 29, 2010
Added ISO reading functionality to wmm_point.c creating wmm_point_ISO.c



Novemb 22, 2011
